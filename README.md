# USW-LS

## Execute with runsolver

For USW-LS:
./starexec_usw-ls-runsolver.sh filename seed cutofftime

This work has been accepted by the SAT conference 2024. The USW-LS local search algorithm was also applied in the NuWLS-c solver submitted to the MaxSAT Evaluation 2023.

## Supported Format
   
   USW-LS currently supports the format of instances for MaxSAT Evaluations before 2022.

   To understand the format supported by NuWLS, please refer to the MaxSAT Evaluation 2022 rules
 (https://maxsat-evaluations.github.io/2022/rules.html#input).


## Format Conversion
   
   You can use the code available here (https://bitbucket.org/fbacchus/maxsat_benchmarks_code_base/src/master/) to convert new format to the old format.
